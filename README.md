# My website [davidxiao.me](http://davidxiao.me/)

The whole site is generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Firehose](https://firebase.google.com/). It is intended to be fully static, utilizing Firehose free tier storage and stay as much lightweight as possible.

## Installation

- Install hugo on your local environment
- Install Google Cloud SDK command line utility on your local environment
- Install Firebase command line utility on your local environment
- Set up a Firehose account and create a new firehose project
- Configure firebase authentication using either service account (recommended) or user
- Run `hugo server -D` on the project root directory; test it at [http://127.0.0.1:1313/]
- Run `hugo && firebase deploy` to push the website to firehose
