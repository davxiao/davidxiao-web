## Cruising Altitudes

When flying VFR above 3,000 AGL, remember "East is Odd, West is Even Odder" on Magnetic Track (not Magnetic Heading)

602.34 [Cruising Altitudes and Cruising Flight Levels](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-96-433/FullText.html#h-993895)

## En Route Climb

Lookout to clear the climb

APT - Attitude, Power (control the adverse yaw), Trim

Level off from climbing - The same APT applies.

[Ref](https://www.studyflight.com/climbing/)

Climb

```
Pitch up and hold the nose on the horizon.

Peek at A/S as it decreases to 75

Full Power, Mix Rich. Carb Off. Right rudder.

Trim.
```

Level Off

Starts at 50-100ft below target. Gradually push the nose down to cruise attitude.

Reduce Power to Cruise, 2300rpm. Left Rudder when needed

## En Route Decent

Lookout to clear the decent

PAT - Power (control the adverse yaw), Attitude, Trim

Level off from climbing - The same APT applies.

[Ref](https://www.studyflight.com/descending/)

## Normal Takeoff

Take-off Distance is the sum of the following three distances in one continuous maneuver:

- Takeoff roll (ground roll)

- Lift-off
- Initial Climb until clear 50ftt obstacle

*Confirm Wind Input before takeoff. Use Cross-wind Take-off Checklist if needed.*

```
Elevator neutral. Aileron neutral. No flaps.

Full Power. Mix Rich. Carb Cold. Call "Power Set".

Stay on the centerline, use Right Rudder as needed.

Check and call "Engine gauges green".

Check and call "Airspeed alive".

Wings level. Rotate at 55. Right Rudder! Call "Rotate".

Nose on the Horizon.

Call "____, <callsign> airborne Rwy __"

Climb out at 70. Trim.
```

### Normal Landing

Important: Set mindset as "keep it flying without landing"

On Down Wind:

```
Set Power to 2300rpm.

Fly parallel to the landing Runway. Use a Crab angle when needed

Pre-landing checklist.
(Primer locked, Master ON, Magneto on Both, Circuit Breakers
Check, Landing Lights ON, Carb ON, Mix Rich, Engine Green,
Fuel on Both, Doors and Windows Locked, Seatbelts fastened,
Brakes Check)

"Pre-landing Checklist Complete"

"Aiming to touch down at one third of the Rwy"

At 45 degrees beyond threshold (turn early when having a
tailwind), reduce power to 1500rpm, holding the
altitude while making a turn to base.

Call "___, <callsign>, turning base for Rwy __"
```

On Base Leg:

```
Holding the altitude while bleeding off A/S until it reaches
75 knots

Apply flaps 20 (be careful not to ballon up) and trim for 75

Anticipate a 500fpm decent.

Look out for Wind

  *** Not to overshoot when having a tail wind

  *** Not to fly off track when having a wind from Rwy

  *** Turn early when having a tail wind and/or wind from Rwy

Turning Final and call "___, <callsign>, turning final
on Rwy __. [Tough-n-Go / Full Stop]"
```

On Final:

```
Apply full flaps.

A/S 65. Trim.

Line up early on the extended runway centerline.

Fly with a crab angle initially to correct for drift.

Pitch for Airspeed, Power for altitude

Transition to Sideslip.

When getting the vision of "exploding" runway:
  Power to Idle, Hold control column, transition to cruise
  attitude.
  Judge the sink rate using peripheral vision.
  When sinking, do baby steps of "pull-pause-pull" to
  keep the nose slight below horizon.
  When not sinking, hold the control column but no pulling.

When touches down completely:
  Wind input -
    Aileron fully deflected into the wind
    Opposite Rudder to stay on the centerline
```

### Short Field Landing

On Down wind:

```
"Aiming to touch down at second dash"
```

On Final:

```
Approach speed: 60

"There is an 50ft obstacle before threshold"

When obstacle is cleared, power to idle and push nose to
maintain 60

After touching down, HOLD control full back and RETRACT flaps
and APPLY maximum brake pressure

(from C172 POH)
```

### Soft Field Landing

On Down wind:

```
"Aiming to touch down at one third of the Rwy"
```

On Final:

```
Perform a 60kt approach on final

Power to Idle and enter cruising attitude as normal landing

Immediately after entering cruising attitude but before it
starts sinking:
  Apply small amount of power (100 to 200rpm is enough)

Touching down at a more nose up attitude than normal landing
(textbook says roughtly the attitude of a power-off stall)

During the flaring control column likely has more back travel
than normal landing. It can be close to the belly when
touching down

After touchdown, HOLD control full back and DO NOT apply heavy
brake pressure
```

### Power-off Stall Entry and Recovery

On straight and level flight

```
HASEL CHECK

(Carb ON, Mix Rich)

Power to Idle smoothly while controlling yaw

Hold back control pressure to keep airplane straight and level

Watch A/S decreases into slow flight range.

Call out immiment stall by "STALL" when hearing horn and losing
altitude

Call out "RECOVER" and immediately nose down and apply full power
and control yaw

```

### Power-on Stall Entry and Recovery

```
Entry:

Power to 1700rpm

everything else is similiar to that of a power off stall.

Expect more challenging yaw control due to slipstream and asymmetric thrust

use RUDDER to control yaw

Stall will happen in a more hose-up position

it will be judged if heading can be kept during recovery

```
