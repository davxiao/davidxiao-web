The guides I've read and followed through:

- ðŸ‘‰ The [step-by-step guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) on reactjs.org

## Basics

- Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

  An element describes what you want to see on the screen: `const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;`

  Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
