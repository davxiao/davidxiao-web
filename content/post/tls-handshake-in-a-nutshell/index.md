At a high level, the following occurs during a TLS handshake:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client establishes a TCP connection to the server] -->B[Client sends Hello and list of cipher suites including TLS version] -->C[Server sends Hello, selected suite and certificate] --> D[Client validates certificate]
    D --> E[Client and server starts key exchange process. <br/>RSA and Diffie-Hellman are two common KEP algogirhtms]
    E --> F{Key Exchange Protocol}
    F -->|RSA| G[When both client and server have <br/>the client random, the server random, <br/>and the premaster secret, each side <br/>independently combine these three inputs<br/> to come up with the session keys. <br/>They should both arrive at the same value]
    F -->|DH| H[Both client and server independently <br/>agree on the same secret value using DH algorithm<br/> usually accompanied by RSA signature]
    G -->I[Regardless of which KEP was used, <br/>the rest of the session uses the agreed key, an ephemeral symmetric key, <br/>to encrypt the communication both ways going forward]
    H -->I
```

## Key Takeaways About the KEPs

ðŸ‘‰ DH achieves forward secrecy while RSA does not.

ðŸ‘‰ DH handshake takes longer than RSA.

## What Else You Need To Know about TLS

- TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are no longer secure and should be avoided. A best practice is to use TLS version is 1.2 or later at the time of writing.

- HTTPS means "HTTP over TLS".

- Both SSH and TLS are purpose-built for secure communication over the Internet, but they are very different in many ways. Check out [my another post]({{< ref "/post/ssh-and-tls" >}}) where I explain the differences between the two.

## Glossary

### Cipher Suite

A cipher suite is a set of algorithms. It usually contain include: a key exchange algorithm, a bulk encryption algorithm, and a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm.

For example, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` means:

- ECDHE_RSA indicates the key exchange algorithm being used.

- AES_128_GCM indicates the block cipher being used to encrypt the message stream, together with the block cipher mode of operation.
- SHA256 indicates the message authentication algorithm which is used to authenticate a message.

### ECDHE_RSA key exchange algorithm

In a nutshell, it is ECDHE signed by RSA. Signing defeats man-in-the-middle attack. See detail [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie-Hellman)
