A drop bar road bike in black painting fell off my bike rack between around 4-5pm when I was driving westbound on St.John between Yonge and Bathurst  then Southbound on Bathurst towards Richmond Hill. 
I turned around in ten minutes but did not see it. If anyone has it please DM me. Much appreciated!
