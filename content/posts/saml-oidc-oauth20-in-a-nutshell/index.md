# SAML and OIDC
Both SAML and OIDC are authentication protocols and some times were referred to as identity protocols.

The basic login flow for both is the same.

- A user logs in to the Identity Provider.
- They select which app they want to go to.
- The user’s information is passed from the IdP to the user’s browser.
- Their information is then passed on to the application.
- The application confirms they are authorized to access resources.
- The user is allowed into the application.
