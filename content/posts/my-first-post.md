This is my first post on my own website. So I decided to write about how I built this website from the ground up. Hopefully you'll find it interesting to read.

But first, allow me to jibber-jabber a little bit on it...

Back in the 90's when I first came across internet and web, whoever knows just anything about how to create a website would be considered highly technical and kind of cool.

Fast forward a few years to 2000, when [Dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) was at its best, for any decent web developer, he or she would have to know not just basic html tags but but also how to use .css and web creation tools such as dreamweaver.

Fast forward again to 2010s, server side script languages such as PHP and Ruby on Rails are pretty hot. Perhaps it is just my perception but I remember clearly how most web developers are either front-end developers or back-end developers, despite many claimed they are "full-stack" web engineers.

Now that it's 2020, social media and smart phone is anywhere and everywhere, it makes [content creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation) possible for just anyone who wants to publish something on the internet.

The big question is: " WHERE ? "
