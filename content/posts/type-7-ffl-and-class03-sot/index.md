## What is FFL and SOT in the United States

Before you apply for an FFL, you really need to know what types of FFL is best for you. Not all FFL’s are the same, they allow you to deal, sell or collect different things. For instance, a person who only wants to collect old guns doesn’t need a license that allows for manufacturing silencers. On the other hand, a gunsmith isn’t going to get a license to import exotic ammunition. So let’s take a look at the different types of FFL’s out there and what these FFL license types do.

Each FFL is known as a "Type". You hear people say “Type 07 FFL” or “Type 03” FFL. There is some confusion when you add what is known as a SOT (Special Occupation Tax) to certain kinds of FFL’s. These are “class” type SOT's. When you hear people talk about “Class 03” FFL, it really means they’ve added a Class 03 SOT to their FFL license.

## What is Type 07 FFL

Type 07 FFL – Manufacturer of Firearms & Ammunition

The Type 07 FFL is the most powerful and popular FFL to get. With it you can do everything a Type 01 FFL can (buy, sell and repair firearms) plus manufacture guns and ammo. When you add a Class 03 SOT to this license you can also make NFA items like silencers and even machine guns.

With the growing popularity of silencers, short barrel rifles and shotguns and other NFA items, many gun dealers choose a Type 07 license so they can serve all their customer’s needs. With the rising popularity of AR-type sporting rifles and the wide availability of parts, many Type 07 FFL holders are choosing to manufacture custom rifles for resale.

Get this FFL if you want the freedom to make and sell guns and ammo, and to add a Class 03 SOT to tap the lucrative NFA market. The Type 07 FFL costs $150 to apply and $150 to renew every 3 years.
